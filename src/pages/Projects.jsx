This gives a unique perspective on the game world, making it much larger than you can ever imagine. The game is planned to have a focus on providing an interesting combination of combat and puzzles, using a whimsical story that draws inspiration from the storytelling techniques that Studio Ghibli use in their films. "
      + "\n\nOur game draws inspiration from games such as Fez, and Hollow Knight. Fez inspired the unique mechanic of how the world is perceived by our mice protagonist. Fez brought on the original idea of this game, the mechanics that create the world of this game are very unique, and we wish to recreate the feelings of this game’s atmosphere created by the two-dimensional perspective. Considering the mechanics that we’ve chosen to use, our competitive landscape would be along indie classics like Fez. The audience we’d be targeting are people who are interested in a new take on the style of game, adding good platforming and combat, to provide a unique experience like none other. ",

I wanted to make this game because it would allow me to work a lot on game design work, rather than mostly doing program work. This is still a work in progress, but I will be updating this as time goes forward. "
      +"\n\nA major mechanic in this game that I came up with is the use of color to tell the player how happy they and their neighbors are. The less happy a Character is, the more grey the around around them is. As the player interacts and helps NPCs, the NPCs will begin to gain color, signifying their happiness. The hope is to show the player that helping others makes the world a better place. "
      +"\n\nOn top of this, the game features a dialogue system that I created, that using Twine, twinestory and twine_to_json. Using these to make readable json files out of the html files that are outputted from Twine, to then be parsed by my scripts. This system allows for other people to not have to touch code, and still be able to create dialogues easily, and quickly.",

The difficulty in making this game was getting our team to coordinate better than in other projects, we had many different things that needed to be done as we had never made a full game as a team, and organization and communication was the thing that I learned the most out of this project.
